# align: a grid specification primitive for R

working labels: align, step, vast

## What it is

align is a pure R package that provides a single core object: a grid specification defined by dimension and extent. Everything else — resolution, coordinates, cell indices, row/column mappings — is derived on demand by arithmetic.

The grid spec is a window onto an infinite regular lattice. Crop, expand, and resize operations produce new specs on the same lattice (or an integer-related one). Content — coverage fractions, raster values, sparse indexes — references the grid by index and is not part of the grid itself.

## The object

```r
g <- vast(c(100L, 200L))
# dimension: 100 x 200 (ncol x nrow)
# extent: c(0, 100, 0, 200)
# resolution: 1 x 1

g <- vast(c(500L, 300L), extent = c(140, 160, -50, -30))
# dimension: 500 x 300
# extent: c(140, 160, -50, -30)
# resolution: 0.04 x 0.0667

g <- vast_res(extent = c(140, 160, -50, -30), resolution = 0.04)
# dimension derived: c(500, 500)
# equivalent to: vast(ceiling(c(20, 20) / 0.04), extent)
```

### Storage

Two values, always present:

- `dimension`: integer vector, `c(ncol, nrow)`
- `extent`: numeric vector, `c(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)`

That's it. No resolution field, no CRS, no data, no cell values.

### Default extent

```r
vast(c(100L, 200L))
# extent defaults to c(0, ncol, 0, nrow) — unit cell space
```

This gives an identity mapping where column index = x coordinate and row index = y coordinate. The unit grid is pure index space with no geographic pretension.

### Derived quantities

All computed, never stored:

```r
ncol(g)          # dimension[1]
nrow(g)          # dimension[2]
ncell(g)         # prod(dimension)
res(g)           # c(dx, dy) = c(diff(extent[1:2]) / ncol, diff(extent[3:4]) / nrow)

# coordinate vectors — sequences, not stored arrays
x(g)             # xmin + (seq_len(ncol) - 0.5) * dx  (cell centres)
y(g)             # ymax - (seq_len(nrow) - 0.5) * dy  (cell centres, top to bottom)

# index <-> coordinate conversions
cell_from_xy(g, xy)          # integer cell index (1-based)
xy_from_cell(g, cell)        # 2-column matrix
cell_from_rowcol(g, row, col)
rowcol_from_cell(g, cell)
row_from_y(g, y)
col_from_x(g, x)
x_from_col(g, col)
y_from_row(g, row)
```

These are all one-line arithmetic expressions. No lookup tables, no allocations beyond the result vector.

## Operations

### Crop

Restrict the extent. Snaps to cell boundaries of the parent grid.

```r
crop(g, extent)
# 1. snap requested extent inward to nearest cell boundaries
# 2. compute new dimension from snapped extent / resolution
# 3. return vast(new_dim, snapped_extent)
```

The resolution doesn't change. The new grid is a subwindow of the old one. Row/column offsets between parent and child are exact integers.

```r
child <- crop(g, c(141, 155, -45, -35))
offset(child, g)
# c(col_off, row_off) — integer offset from parent origin to child origin
```

### Expand

Widen the extent. The inverse of crop — snaps outward to cell boundaries.

```r
expand(g, extent)
# snap outward, compute new dimension
```

expand + crop are symmetric: `crop(expand(g, e), g$extent)` returns `g`.

### Resize

Change resolution by an integer factor. The new lattice nests exactly within the old one.

```r
resize(g, factor = 2L)
# double resolution: dim * 2, extent unchanged
# every old cell becomes a 2x2 block

resize(g, factor = 0.5)
# halve resolution: dim / 2, extent unchanged
# every 2x2 block becomes one cell
# dimension must be divisible by 1/factor
```

`factor` must produce exact integer dimensions. This is the alignment invariant — you can't resize to a resolution that breaks the lattice.

### Align check

Test whether two grids share a lattice (same origin modulo resolution, commensurate resolutions).

```r
is_aligned(g1, g2)
# TRUE if g2's cell boundaries fall exactly on g1's cell boundaries
# (or vice versa)

snap(g, parent)
# snap g's extent to parent's cell boundaries
# error if resolutions are not commensurate
```

### Tile

Partition a grid into subwindows.

```r
tiles(g, tile_dim = c(256L, 256L))
# returns a list of vast objects, each tile_dim or smaller (edge tiles)
# all aligned to g
```

This is pure index arithmetic — how many tiles fit, what are their extents. No data, no I/O.

## What align does NOT do

- Store raster values
- Read or write files
- Handle CRS or projection
- Do geometry operations
- Allocate large arrays

align is six numbers and arithmetic on them. It validates alignment and computes indices. That's the entire scope.

## Type and class

Start with a named list and an S3 class:

```r
vast <- function(dimension, extent = NULL) {
  dimension <- as.integer(dimension)
  stopifnot(length(dimension) == 2L, all(dimension > 0L))

  if (is.null(extent)) {
    extent <- c(0, dimension[1], 0, dimension[2])
  }
  extent <- as.double(extent)
  stopifnot(length(extent) == 4L, extent[2] > extent[1], extent[4] > extent[3])

  structure(
    list(dimension = dimension, extent = extent),
    class = "vast"
  )
}
```

Consider S7 later if method dispatch gets complex. For now, S3 is fine — the operations are functions on the type, not a class hierarchy.

### Print

```r
print.vast <- function(x, ...) {
  r <- res(x)
  cat(sprintf("<vast> %d x %d (%.6g x %.6g)\n",
      x$dimension[1], x$dimension[2], r[1], r[2]))
  cat(sprintf("  x: [%g, %g]\n  y: [%g, %g]\n",
      x$extent[1], x$extent[2], x$extent[3], x$extent[4]))
  invisible(x)
}
```

## Aliases

```r
vast_res <- function(extent, resolution) {
  extent <- as.double(extent)
  resolution <- as.double(rep_len(resolution, 2L))
  dimension <- ceiling(c(
    diff(extent[1:2]) / resolution[1],
    diff(extent[3:4]) / resolution[2]
  ))
  # adjust extent to honour exact resolution
  extent[2] <- extent[1] + dimension[1] * resolution[1]
  extent[4] <- extent[3] + dimension[2] * resolution[2]
  vast(dimension, extent)
}
```

Other entry points that call `vast()`:

```r
# from a terra/raster object
as_vast <- function(x, ...) UseMethod("as_vast")
as_vast.SpatRaster <- function(x, ...) {
  vast(c(ncol(x), nrow(x)), as.vector(terra::ext(x))[c(1,2,3,4)])
}

# from controlledburn output
as_vast.controlledburn <- function(x, ...) {
  vast(x$dimension, x$extent)
}
```

## Relationship to other packages

### controlledburn

controlledburn produces sparse runs + edges on a grid. `materialise_chunk()` needs to:
1. Accept a target `vast` object (subwindow of the parent grid)
2. Validate alignment via `is_aligned()`
3. Compute row/col offset via `offset()`
4. Filter and reindex runs/edges
5. Fill a matrix of the target's dimensions

align provides steps 1–4. controlledburn does step 5.

### vaster

vaster currently implements cell-from-xy, extent alignment, dimension fitting. The core of that logic moves into align as the `vast` object and its methods. vaster becomes a higher-level package that imports align and adds convenience for terra/raster/stars interop.

### grout

grout handles tile schemes and validates spatial alignment for cloud-native raster workflows. Its tile partitioning logic (`tiles()`) belongs in or delegates to align. grout adds the I/O coordination — which tiles exist, what format, where.

### DuckDB / arrow workflows

The sparse output from controlledburn is a data frame. Index remapping (crop/resize) on that data frame is row filtering + integer arithmetic on the index columns. align provides the grid spec and the arithmetic; the query engine (DuckDB, arrow, data.table) provides the execution.

```r
parent <- as_vast(burn_result)
tile   <- crop(parent, tile_extent)
off    <- offset(tile, parent)

# pure index operation — works in DuckDB, arrow, or base R
runs |>
  filter(row >= off[2] + 1, row <= off[2] + nrow(tile)) |>
  filter(col_end >= off[1] + 1, col_start <= off[1] + ncol(tile)) |>
  mutate(
    row = row - off[2],
    col_start = pmax(col_start - off[1], 1L),
    col_end = pmin(col_end - off[1], ncol(tile))
  )
```

## Resolution collapse

Given a controlledburn object on a parent grid and a target grid at coarser resolution (integer multiple), produce a new controlledburn object without materialising either grid.

```r
# parent: 1000 x 1000
# target: 100 x 100 (10x coarser, same extent)

parent_grid <- as_vast(burn_result)
target_grid <- resize(parent_grid, factor = 0.1)

# interior runs: divide col_start/col_end by 10, merge adjacent
# edge cells at run boundaries: aggregate coverage within 10x10 blocks
# interior of runs at coarse scale: still 1.0, no computation
# result: new controlledburn object on target_grid
```

The vast majority of cells (interior runs) collapse by dividing two integers. Only the O(perimeter) boundary cells need actual aggregation. This is pyramid generation from the sparse format.

align provides `resize()` and the block-mapping arithmetic. The aggregation logic (how to combine coverage fractions within a block) lives in controlledburn or in a general sparse-index-collapse package.

## Implementation plan

1. `vast()` constructor + validation + print
2. `res()`, `ncol()`, `nrow()`, `ncell()`
3. `x()`, `y()`, coordinate vectors
4. `cell_from_xy()`, `xy_from_cell()`, `cell_from_rowcol()`, `rowcol_from_cell()` — the vaster core
5. `crop()`, `expand()` with snap-to-cell
6. `offset()` — integer displacement between aligned grids
7. `is_aligned()`, `snap()`
8. `resize()` with integer-factor validation
9. `tiles()` — partition into subwindows
10. `vast_res()` and `as_vast()` methods
11. Update controlledburn `materialise_chunk()` to accept a `vast` target
12. Migrate vaster's core index arithmetic to align

All pure R. No compiled code. No dependencies beyond base R (wk is not needed — align has no geometry). The test suite is arithmetic identities — round-trip conversions, crop/expand symmetry, alignment invariants.

## The alignment prison

The invariant that makes everything work: two `vast` objects are *compatible* if and only if their cell boundaries coincide. This means:

1. Same origin (modulo resolution): `(extent[1] - other$extent[1]) %% dx == 0`
2. Commensurate resolution: one resolution is an exact integer multiple of the other

If these hold, every index operation (crop, offset, resize, tile, reindex) produces exact integer results. No floating-point negotiation, no half-cell shifts, no off-by-one ambiguity.

If they don't hold, align refuses to proceed. The type system prevents misaligned operations by construction. That's the prison — and it's the entire value of the package.
